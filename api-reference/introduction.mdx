## Why use Morph?
Frontier models like Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude are extremely good at reasoning, but they can be extremely slow, brittle, and expensive to apply updates to your code and files. 
Morph Apply is a model optimized for speed, applying updates suggested by these models to original files in at 2000+ tokens per second.

## How It Works

Morph provides an OpenAI-compatible API that takes two primary inputs:
1. Your original code file
2. The update snippet (changes suggested by an LLM)

Our specialized model then applies these changes with maximum speed (2000+ tokens/second) and accuracy, preserving code structure and formatting.
