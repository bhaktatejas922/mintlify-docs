description: 'Apply edits from models like GPT-4o and Claude to your files instantly with Morph API'
---

## Why use Morph?
Models like Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude are extremely good at reasoning, but they can be extremely slow and expensive to apply updates to your code and files. 
Morph Apply is a model optimized for speed, applying updates suggested by these models to original files in at 2000+ tokens per second.

## How It Works

<div className="flex gap-8">
  <div className="flex-1">
    <p>Morph provides an OpenAI-compatible API that takes two primary inputs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your original code/text file</li>
      <li>The update snippet (changes suggested by an LLM)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our specialized model then applies these changes at 2000+ tokens/second with 99% accuracy.</p>
  </div>

<Info>
We offer the full Morph model suite with dedicated instances, self-hosted, or on-premises deployments. Reach out to [info@morphllm.com](mailto:info@morphllm.com).
Dedicated instances see ~40% faster inference than our public API.

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.morphllm.com/v1
```

## Compatible with OpenAI SDK

Morph's API is compatible with the OpenAI SDK. You only need to change the base URL and API key:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript/Node.js
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: 'https://api.morphllm.com/v1',
    apiKey: 'your-morph-api-key'
});

// Use the client exactly like OpenAI
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'morph-apply',
    messages: [
        { role: 'user', content: 'Apply this edit to my code...' }
    ]
});
```

```python Python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.morphllm.com/v1",
    api_key="your-morph-api-key"
)

# Use the client exactly like OpenAI
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="morph-apply",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Apply this edit to my code..."}
    ]
)
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.morphllm.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-morph-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "morph-apply",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Apply this edit to my code..."
      }
    ]
  }'
```
