## Why use Morph?
Models like Gemini, GPT-4o, and Claude are extremely good at reasoning, but they can be extremely slow and expensive to apply updates to your code and files. 
Morph Apply is a model optimized for speed, applying updates suggested by these models to original files in at 2000+ tokens per second.

## How It Works

<div className="flex gap-8">
  <div className="flex-1">
    <p>Morph provides an OpenAI-compatible API that takes two primary inputs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your original code file</li>
      <li>The update snippet (changes suggested by an LLM)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our specialized model then applies these changes at 2500+ tokens/second with 99% accuracy.</p>
