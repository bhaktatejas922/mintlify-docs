## Welcome to Morph API

Morph is the fastest way to apply updates from frontier models like GPT-4o and Claude to your code files. 

## Why use Morph?
Frontier models like GPT-4o and Claude are powerful, but they can be extremely slow and expensive to apply updates to your code and files. 
Morph Apply is a model optimized for speed, applying updates suggested by these models to original files in at 1600+ tokens per second.

## How It Works

Morph provides an OpenAI-compatible API that takes two primary inputs:
1. Your original code file
2. The update snippet (changes suggested by an LLM)

Our specialized model then applies these changes with maximum speed and accuracy, preserving code structure and formatting.
