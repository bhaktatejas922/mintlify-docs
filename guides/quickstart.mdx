## ① Prompt Your Agent

Configure your AI agent with the proper system prompt to handle code editing effectively:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="System Prompt Configuration">

Add this to your AI agent's system prompt:

```xml
<making_code_changes>
When making code changes, NEVER output code to the USER, unless requested. Instead use one of the code edit tools to implement the change. Use the code edit tools at most once per turn. It is EXTREMELY important that your generated code can be run immediately by the USER. To ensure this, follow these instructions carefully:

Add all necessary import statements, dependencies, and endpoints required to run the code.
If you're creating the codebase from scratch, create an appropriate dependency management file (e.g. requirements.txt) with package versions and a helpful README.
If you're building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.
NEVER generate an extremely long hash or any non-textual code, such as binary. These are not helpful to the USER and are very expensive.
Unless you are appending some small easy to apply edit to a file, or creating a new file, you MUST read the the contents or section of what you're editing before editing it.
If you've introduced (linter) errors, please try to fix them. But, do NOT loop more than 3 times when doing this. On the third time, ask the user if you should keep going.
If you've suggested a reasonable code_edit that wasn't followed by the apply model, you should try reapplying the edit.
</making_code_changes>

<tool_calling>
ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.
The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.
NEVER refer to tool names when speaking to the USER. For example, instead of saying 'I need to use the edit_file tool to edit your file', just say 'I will edit your file'.
Only calls tools when they are necessary. If the USER's task is general or you already know the answer, just respond without calling tools.
Before calling each tool, first explain to the USER why you are calling it.
</tool_calling>
```

These prompts ensure your agent:
- Uses edit tools instead of outputting code directly
- Handles errors gracefully with retry logic
- Maintains professional communication without exposing tool names
- Only calls tools when necessary

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## ② The Edit File Tool

Implement the edit_file tool in your AI agent with the proper prompt and schema:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="XML (Recommended)">

**Tool Description:**
```xml
Use this tool to propose an edit to an existing file.

This will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.

When writing the edit, you should specify each edit in sequence, with the special comment // ... existing code ... to represent unchanged code in between edited lines.

For example:

// ... existing code ...
FIRST_EDIT
// ... existing code ...
SECOND_EDIT
// ... existing code ...
THIRD_EDIT
// ... existing code ...

You should bias towards repeating as few lines of the original file as possible to convey the change.
Each edit should contain sufficient context of unchanged lines around the code you're editing to resolve ambiguity.
If you plan on deleting a section, you must provide surrounding context to indicate the deletion.
DO NOT omit spans of pre-existing code without using the // ... existing code ... comment to indicate its absence.
```

**Parameters:**
- `target_file` (string, required): The target file to modify  
- `code_edit` (string, required): Specify ONLY the precise lines of code that you wish to edit. Use `// ... existing code ...` for unchanged sections.

</Tab>
<Tab title="JSON (Simple)">

**Tool Definition:**
```json
{
  "name": "edit_file",
  "description": "Use this tool to propose an edit to an existing file.\n\nThis will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit.

  "parameters": {
    "properties": {
      "target_file": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The target file to modify."
      },
      "code_edit": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Specify ONLY the precise lines of code that you wish to edit. Use // ... existing code ... for unchanged sections."
      }
    },
    "required": ["target_file", "code_edit"]
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Example Edit Pattern:**

```javascript
// Original code:
function calculateTotal(items) {
  total = 0;
  for item in items:
    total += item.price;
  return total;
}

// Edit with markers:
function calculateTotal(items) {
  // ... existing code ...
  for item in items:
    total += item.price;
  return total * 1.1;  // Add 10% tax
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `// ... existing code ...` to indicate unchanged sections
- Provide sufficient context around edits for proper placement
- Keep instructions concise and action-oriented
- Minimize token usage by not repeating large unchanged sections

## ③ Pass to Morph API

When your agent calls the edit_file tool, send the original file content and update snippet to Morph:

<Card
  title="Morph API Documentation"
  icon="bolt"
  href="/api-reference/endpoint/apply"
>
  View our OpenAI-compatible API
</Card>

**API Base URL:**
```bash
https://api.morphllm.com/v1
```

**Implementation Example:**

<CodeGroup>

```typescript edit-file-tool.ts
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Initialize the OpenAI client with Morph's API endpoint
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.MORPH_API_KEY || 'your-morph-api-key',
  baseURL: 'https://api.morphllm.com/v1'
});

async function editFile(params: {
  target_file: string;
  code_edit: string;
}): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string; error?: any }> {
  try {
    // 1. Read the original file
    const originalContent = await fs.readFile(params.target_file, 'utf8');
    
    // 2. Send to Morph API
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'morph-v2',
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: `<code>${originalContent}</code>\n<update>${params.code_edit}</update>`
        }
      ]
    });
    
    // 3. Write the updated content back to the file
    await fs.writeFile(params.target_file, response.choices[0].message.content);
    
    return {
      success: true,
      message: `File ${params.target_file} was successfully updated`
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      message: `Error: ${error.message}`,
      error
    };
  }
}
```

```python edit_file_tool.py
import os
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the OpenAI client with Morph's API endpoint
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.getenv("MORPH_API_KEY", "your-morph-api-key"),
    base_url="https://api.morphllm.com/v1"
)

def edit_file(target_file: str, code_edit: str) -> dict:
    try:
        # 1. Read the original file
        with open(target_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            original_content = f.read()
        
        # 2. Send to Morph API
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="morph-v2",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": f"<code>{original_content}</code>\n<update>{code_edit}</update>"
                }
            ]
        )
        
        # 3. Write the updated content back to the file
        with open(target_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(response.choices[0].message.content)
        
        return {
            "success": True,
            "message": f"File {target_file} was successfully updated"
        }
    except Exception as error:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "message": f"Error: {str(error)}",
            "error": error
        }
```

</CodeGroup>

**Input Format:**

The Morph API expects two key components:
- **Original code** wrapped in `<code>...</code>` tags
- **Update snippet** wrapped in `<update>...</update>` tags

The update snippet should use truncation markers like `// ... existing code ...` to indicate unchanged parts of the code.

**Why Morph?**

Morph's apply model offers significant advantages over search/replace or full file rewriting:

- **Speed**: Process edits at 2000+ tokens per second
- **Native**: Models can output code in a natural way without artificial constraints on output format which bias code results
- **Accuracy**: Precise application of changes with context awareness
- **Cost-effective**: >4x lower token usage compared to generating entire files
