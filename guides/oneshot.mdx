# One Shot: edit_file Tool for Cursor

Get a production-ready `edit_file` tool. Paste into Cursor/Windsurf/Cline/Continue/other AI IDEs.

<Note>
   Many research papers have shown that having LLMs like Claude/Gemini do code edits via normal JSON tool calls results in worse overall coding performance due to constrained decoding.
   For the best coding performance, you can use XML tags for your tool calls. See how [Cline](https://docs.cline.bot/exploring-clines-tools/cline-tools-guide#cline-tools-reference-guide) and [Cursor](https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/cursor-ide-sonnet_20241224.md) use XML tags for all their tool calls.

## Quick Copy-Paste Implementation

<CodeGroup>

``` oneshot.txt
Implement an edit_file tool that uses Morph's fast apply API to modify files. The tool should read the current file content, send it to Morph's API at https://api.morphllm.com/v1 using the morph-v2 model with the original code in <code> tags and the proposed edit from our Agent in the <update> tags, then write the updated content back to the file. Use the MORPH_API_KEY environment variable for authentication and an OpenAI-compatible client. The tool parameters should be: target_file (string, required), instructions (string, required - single sentence describing the edit in first person), code_edit (string, required - only the lines to change with // ... existing code ... comments for unchanged sections). Return success/error status with descriptive messages and handle file I/O and API errors gracefully. Implement this now using whatever framework I'm currently using.
Do not modify the descriptions wording at all. Read relevant files to understand how we currently do edits before implementing.

ex: 
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Initialize the OpenAI client with Morph's API endpoint
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'your-morph-api-key',
  baseURL: 'https://api.morphllm.com/v1'
});

async function applyChanges(originalCode: string, updatedCode: string): Promise<string> {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "morph-v2",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: `<code>${originalCode}</code>\n<update>${updatedCode}</update>`
      }
    ]
  });
  
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}

ex using Vercel AI sdk 

import { tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';
import * as fs from 'fs/promises';
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';

const morphClient = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.MORPH_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.morphllm.com/v1'
});

const editFile = tool({
  description: "Use this tool to propose an edit to an existing file.\n\nThis will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged code you write.\nWhen writing the edit, you should specify each edit in sequence, with the special comment // ... existing code ... to represent unchanged code in between edited lines.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\n// ... existing code ...\\nFIRST_EDIT\\n// ... existing code ...\\nSECOND_EDIT\\n// ... existing code ...\\nTHIRD_EDIT\\n// ... existing code ...\\n\n\nYou should still bias towards repeating as few lines of the original file as possible to convey the change.\nBut, each edit should contain sufficient context of unchanged lines around the code you're editing to resolve ambiguity.\nDO NOT omit spans of pre-existing code without using the // ... existing code ... comment to indicate its absence.\nMake sure it is clear what the edit should be.\n\nYou should specify the following arguments before the others: [target_file]",
  parameters: z.object({
    target_file: z.string().describe('The target file to modify. Always specify the target file as the first argument and use the relative path in the workspace of the file to edit'),
    instructions: z.string().describe('A single sentence instruction describing what you are going to do for the sketched edit. This is used to assist the less intelligent model in applying the edit. Please use the first person to describe what you are going to do. Dont repeat what you have said previously in normal messages. And use it to disambiguate uncertainty in the edit.'),
    code_edit: z.string().describe('Specify ONLY the precise lines of code that you wish to edit. NEVER specify or write out unchanged code. Instead, represent all unchanged code using the comment of the language you\'re editing in - example: // ... existing code ...'),
  }),
  execute: async ({ target_file, instructions, code_edit }) => {
    try {
      // Read the current file content
      const originalCode = await fs.readFile(target_file, 'utf-8');
      
      // Use Morph's fast apply API to generate the updated code
      const response = await morphClient.chat.completions.create({
        model: "morph-v2",
        messages: [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: `<code>${originalCode}</code>\n<update>${code_edit}</update>`
          }
        ],
        stream: false // set to true if you want to stream the response
      });
      
      const updatedCode = response.choices[0].message.content;
      
      // Write the updated content back to the file
      await fs.writeFile(target_file, updatedCode, 'utf-8');
      
      return {
        success: true,
        message: `Successfully applied edit to ${target_file}: ${instructions}`,
        changes_applied: code_edit
      };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: `Failed to edit ${target_file}: ${error.message}`
      };
    }
  },
});


Implement using whatever framework we're currently using. Write clean, maintainable, high quality code.
